# Local Impedance smoothing

`local_impedance_smoothing.cpp` performs the `Algorithm 4` in section 8.3 with the smoothing method on intermediate layers being the local impedance smoothing, the `iteration_count` routine computes the iteration count for different wave number(2,4,6,8,10,12,14,15,18,20) and domains.
