# PUM Wave-Ray

The `Wave_Ray.cpp` computes the convergence factor of PUM Wave-Ray method for different wave number (wave number ranges from 1 to 10) and different domains, `Algorithm 3` in section 7.3 of the thesis PDF describes this method. `wave_L`, `ray_L`and `ray_coarselayers` are `Lw`, `Lr` and `nr` in thesis.
